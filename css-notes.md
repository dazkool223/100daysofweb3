## When which units to use

These are just the thumbrules to follow. There is always an exception.

- font-size: **rem**
- width: **%** in combination with a max-width, **ch**
- height: question urself "do i really need to set height?" if yes -> use a **min-height**
- padding/margin: **rem or em**, use em for padding of buttons
- media queries: **em**
